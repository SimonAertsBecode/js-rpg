FIRST PART:
(more visual)

1) Create HTML:
- Title
- An element to display both characters stats (visual, name, item, health...) 
- A panel with 6 buttons, 3 for each player (hit, heal & yield. Those are the moves.)
- A creation panel with inputs & dropdowns to create your character. (For now only name, items and race )
- A log that will tell you which move the player made.

2)
use character.js to set all the stats according to what we chose as hero and items

3)
make visible only title, vsScreen and input field when creating characters.

4)
When character is created, creation panel disappear --> moves !and! log should appear.

5) display health bar that should work in real time. make animation for increase/decrease health.
