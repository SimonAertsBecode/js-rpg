You can find my super RPG next level just [here](https://simonaertsbecode.github.io/js-rpg/).

**Hope you'll enjoy it!**

How my project works: You will need two players, each in turn will have to chose a name, race and what item he/she wants.
After that the battle starts.

There's 3 language that have been used to make that RPG, these 3 languages are:

- HTML
- CSS

> These two language have been used to make the interface of the site

<br>

- Javascript

> All the interactions and events have been made with Vanilla Js.
